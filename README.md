## Simulation Model using Probability Sampling for Identifying & Isolating Asymptomatic Cases

<b>Abstract:</b>
This repository contains the codes and data used in our research paper titled: 'An Innovative Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention to Mitigate COVID-
19: Probability Sampling to Identify and Isolate Asymptomatic Cases'. Many recent studies dedicted towards understanding the spread of novel covid-19 have estimated  that majority of the SARS-COV-2 infection occurs through individual not displaying any symptoms. As we all know that the current pandemic prevention measures permit the testing of only those individuals showing syptoms, therefore a large proportion of infections remain undetected. Our papers proposes a novel technique to perform probability sampling over the population and test all the individual part of the sample for covid-19 infection. Our efforts are aimed to effectively identify the covid-19 patients without imposing a mass distruption of day-to-day activity.

For acheiving the above aim, we have used an Agent-Based Model Corvid, which is a stochastic coronavirus epidemic simulation model by Dennis Chao. Corvid is an individual-based model that simulates the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in synthetic populations that represent communities in the United States. It is described in "Modeling layered non-pharmaceutical interventions against SARS-CoV-2 in the United States with Corvid", available on medRxiv (https://doi.org/10.110/2020.04.08.20058487).

Our repository contains the 3 main folders: 
- Data
- Code
- Results

The <b>'data'</b> folder contains all the data files namely of Seattle city that has been used in Corvid <br>
Folder <b>code</b> contains the codes for differents scenarios modelled in our research <br>
Lastly, <b>results</b> folder contains the graphical output of the infection spread output by the model
